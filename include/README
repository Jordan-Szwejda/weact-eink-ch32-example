It is example of support ch32v003 for WeAct 2.13-Black-White-Red eInk display.
It uses RREFont library to print fonts on the display.
Ch32V003 has very limited RAM so there is not possible to create any memory buffer for display memory
and paint fonts there.
Some memory optymization has been applied to render fonts on this chipset. Due to specific memory layout of this display
it is necessary to store whole display block of dimensions 250x8.
That's a simple approach and can be extended and polished to achieve more mature solution. 
At this moment it is possible to render text lines on the display and specify colors of the chars (black or red).
Position of a text line must by multiplication of 8 (due to memory layout of the display).
